/* 
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1

class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        // Create a set to keep track of the numbers that have already been seen
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // Loop until either n becomes 1 (in which case n is a happy number) or n is
        // seen again (in which case n is not a happy number)

        while (n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)) {
            // Add n to the set of seen numbers
            seen.add(n);

            // Compute the sum of the squares of the digits of n
            int sum = 0;
            while (n != 0) {
                int digit = n % 10;
                sum += digit * digit;
                n /= 10;
            }

            // Update n with the sum of the squares of its digits

            n = sum;
        }

        // If n is 1, it is a happy number; otherwise, it is not
        return n == 1;
    }
